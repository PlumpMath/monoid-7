monoid
======


A monoid is a set, S, together with a binary operation "•" (pronounced "dot" or "times") that satisfies the following three axioms:

- **Closure**

    For all a, b in S, the result of the operation a • b is also in S.

- **Associativity**

    For all a, b and c in S, the equation (a • b) • c = a • (b • c) holds.

- **Identity element**
    
    There exists an element e in S, such that for all elements a in S, the equation e • a = a • e = a holds.
